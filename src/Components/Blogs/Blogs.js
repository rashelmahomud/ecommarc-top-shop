                <p><strong>What is Semantics tag: </strong>
                Sementics tag is a excellent work for programing life and its like abale one tag and good wrok for this. 
                A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
                 When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.
                 Sementic tag is a very suitable and excellent work and all aplications for best site and best for her. I mean any developer like this and its working comportable feel do any developer life.
